### Project Summary:
The project is aimed at developing a software application using **C programming language** and **SDL2** library for a company that conducts resource exploration and extraction in the seas. The goal is to maximize profit by dividing the exploration area into optimally sized regions and calculating the associated costs and reserves.

1. **First Phase**: 
   - The program reads the coordinates of exploration areas from a web page and visualizes these areas as polygons on a 2D plane.
   - It calculates the area of the polygon, multiplies it by 10 to estimate the resource reserve, and displays the result.

2. **Second Phase**: 
   - The program divides the resource areas into optimally sized squares (1x1, 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16) based on constraints such as minimizing total cost, platform placement, and drill operations.
   - The total platform and drilling costs are calculated, and the profit is displayed.
